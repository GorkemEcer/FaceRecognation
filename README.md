# FaceRecognation

# Summary
This repository contains the implementation of various facial recognition models, including deep learning CNN models and feature matching techniques. The models explore the use of architectures like Inception CNN with VGGFace2 weights, ResNet50V2, and traditional feature extraction methods for effective facial recognition tasks.

By making run all call all model's test outputs can be show. In additionally all three methods' test sections divided appropriately. If you want to test on a different image, it can be added to the Image Sample folder.

Below the README file drive link which includes all data will be provided.

### Running the Notebooks: Ensure that the dataset paths in the Jupyter Notebooks (*.ipynb) are correctly set to match the local paths where you have downloaded the Kaggle dataset. Modify the dataset paths in the notebook according to your directory structure:
data_path = "/path/to/your/dataset"

Run the Jupyter Notebooks to train the models and evaluate their performance. Each notebook corresponds to different models and techniques explored in this project.

### Viewing Outputs: The outputs for each test can be viewed directly in the notebooks, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of the models' performance.
